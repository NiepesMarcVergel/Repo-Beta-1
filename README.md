## ⚙ Project Description

**Digital Diary** is a modular, console-based C# application that allows users to maintain a personal diary. Users can:
- Write new diary entries
- View all saved entries
- Search entries by date
- Delete by date
- Clear all entries

Entries are stored in a local text file (`diary.txt`) using file handling techniques, ensuring that all data will be saved and can be used  across sessions. This project demonstrates a clean implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#.

## 🔧 Features

- **Write Entries:** Add new entries with timestamped logs.
- **View Entries:** Display all past entries saved in the diary.
- **Search by Date:** Find specific entries using a YYYY-MM-DD formatted date.
- **Delete by Date:** Remove diary entries for a given date.
- **Clear All Entries:** Erase all saved entries in one command.
- **File Persistence:** All data is stored in a text file using `StreamWriter` and `File.ReadAllText`.
- **Error Handling.** Handles invalid inputs and provides user feedback.


## 🕹 OOP Principles Used

- **Encapsulation:** The Diary class encapsulates the filePath field and related operations (WriteEntry, ViewAllEntries, and SearchByDate) to manage diary entries. The filePath is marked as private readonly, which hides it from external classes and prevents modification, protecting the integrity of the data.

- **Abstraction:** The Diary class provides simple public methods to write, view, and search entries without exposing how those operations interact with the file system. The user of the class doesn’t need to understand file handling to use the diary functionality.


- **Modularity:** Functionality is separated into `Diary.cs` for logic and `Program.cs` for user interaction and flow. The Diary class is a self-contained module for diary management. The Program class is responsible for user interaction and control flow, keeping concerns separate from diary logic.


## 📄 How to Run the Application

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C#-compatible IDE.
2. Ensure the following files are present:
   - `Program.cs`
   - `Diary.cs`
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the application.
5. Follow the menu to write, view, or search diary entries.
